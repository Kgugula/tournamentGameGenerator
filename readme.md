# Programming Expert - First Project

## Tournament Game Generator

This is my first completed project as part the ProgrammingExpert.io course. For this project I implented a program that takes user input (i.e. number of teams, team names, how many wins per team during the regular season), and schedules matchups for the first round of a ficticious tournament.

There is more information in the script itself describing assumptions, the flow of work, my general thought process, as well as some notes on potential future features. Give it a try yourself!

I see there is a future project meant to build a blackjack simulator which I'm looking forward to. Can impress friends and practice some of my OOP skills. Excited.
